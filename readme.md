# Temporal Convolutional Networks for Exoplanet Transit Timing Variations

### Objective
Develop a machine learning approach using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to detect and analyze transit timing variations (TTVs) in multi-planet systems. This method aims to reveal hidden planets or provide deeper insights into planetary dynamics.
